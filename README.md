# About
This project started as a curiosity. I was working on a series of interesting tiny python projects and needed ideas. Of course. I was open to any projects. I didn't mind application based projects, or those purely rooted in mathematics, and even programming some nice algorithms. Although, I am more mathematically inclined, I was open to applied problems that might require mathematical modelling as well.

# tinypythonprojects
A collection of tiny Python projects. The ideas were collected, besides from ideas pitched in by someof my friends and my imagination, from reddit suggestions.
